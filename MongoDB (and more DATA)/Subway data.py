    Filenames is a list of MTA Subway turnstile text files. A link to an example
    MTA Subway turnstile text file can be seen at the URL below:
    http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_110507.txt
    
    As you can see, there are numerous data points included in each row of the
    a MTA Subway turnstile text file. 

    You want to write a function that will update each row in the text
    file so there is only one entry per row. A few examples below:
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,003178521,001100739
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,04:00:00,REGULAR,003178541,001100746
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,08:00:00,REGULAR,003178559,001100775
    
    Write the updates to a different text file in the format of "updated_" + filename.
    For example:
        1) if you read in a text file called "turnstile_110521.txt"
        2) you should write the updated data to "updated_turnstile_110521.txt"

    The order of the fields should be preserved. Remember to read through the 
    Instructor Notes below for more details on the task. 
    
    In addition, here is a CSV reader/writer introductory tutorial:
    http://goo.gl/HBbvyy
    
    You can see a sample of the turnstile text file that's passed into this function
    and the the corresponding updated file by downloading these files from the resources:
    
    Sample input file: turnstile_110528.txt
    Sample updated file: solution_turnstile_110528.txt

    reader_in =csv.reader(f_in, delimiter=',') 
    f_out = open('updated_'+ name, 'w') #outputs the file with 'updated' in front
    writer_out = csv.writer(f_out, delimiter=',')
    for line in reader_in: #reads the line from the text
        limit = (len(line)-3)/5 #checks how many times to repeat while loop
        n=0
        while limit>0:
            writer_out.writerow(line[0:3]+line[(3+n*5):(8+n*5)]) #adds 1st 3 entries + multiple of subsequent 5 entries
            n += 1
            limit-=1

    Write a function that takes the files in the list filenames, which all have the 
    columns 'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn', and consolidates
    them into one file located at output_file.  There should be ONE row with the column
    headers, located at the top of the file. The input files do not have column header
    rows of their own.

#Something different (no SQL no pandasql)
            '''
    This function should read the csv file located at filename into a pandas dataframe,
    and filter the dataframe to only rows where the 'DESCn' column has the value 'REGULAR'.
    
    For example, if the pandas dataframe is as follows:
    ,C/A,UNIT,SCP,DATEn,TIMEn,DESCn,ENTRIESn,EXITSn
    0,A002,R051,02-00-00,05-01-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,3144312,1088151

    The dataframe will look like below after filtering to only rows where DESCn column
    has the value 'REGULAR':
    0,A002,R051,02-00-00,05-01-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,3144312,1088151

def get_hourly_entries(df):
'''
    The data in the MTA Subway Turnstile data reports on the cumulative
    number of entries and exits per row.  Assume that you have a dataframe
    called df that contains only the rows for a particular turnstile machine
    (i.e., unique SCP, C/A, and UNIT).  This function should change
    these cumulative entry numbers to a count of entries since the last reading
    (i.e., entries since the last row in the dataframe).
    
    More specifically, you want to do two things:
       1) Create a new column called ENTRIESn_hourly
       2) Assign to the column the difference between ENTRIESn of the current row 
          and the previous row. If there is any NaN, fill/replace it with 1.
    
    You may find the pandas functions shift() and fillna() to be helpful in this exercise.
    
    Examples of what your dataframe should look like at the end of this exercise:
